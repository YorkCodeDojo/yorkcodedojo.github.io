                    <p>First Meeting - Code Golf</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    For our first meeting we decided to start with a fun activity – a game of code golf!<p></p>
                    For those new to the sport, the aim is to solve a given problem using as small a program as possible.  The program size is measured by the number of bytes the source code file requires.<p></p>
                    I had enjoyed solving “Ten Green Bottles” previously at the Leeds Code Dojo, but I wanted us to try something different.  After some thought, I came up with the rhyme “Head Shoulders Knees and Toes”.  The rhyme has 9 verses, where each verse is the same as a previous verse but with an additional word removed.  (See http://codegolf.azurewebsites.net/solution.txt)<p></p>
                    We had about 20 attendees, so we split up into teams of 2 or 3.  The teams used a range of languages including C#, Python, Javascript, Rust and Elixir.  The standard of the competition was high, with some very clever solutions being produced.<p></p>
                    The winning team, imaginatively named “..., ..., ..., ..., ...” (Luke, Garry and Andrew), took an early lead with a python solution containing a base64 encoded compressed version of the text.  Although clever, they thought perhaps it wasn’t quite in the spirit of things.  They went on to code it correctly and still won!<p></p>
                    The other python team “Anarcoders” (Dave and Mel) came a close second, but their 275 bytes didn’t quite catch the winners 230 bytes.<p></p>
                    Credit must be given to team “Magic Potion” (Doug and Steve) who had to also learn to program in Elixir at the same time as completing the challenge.<p></p>
                    An evil(!) solution was produced by team “Java The Script” (Paul and Alice).  Their recursive javascript function didn’t have a base case, so the program only exited due to an error condition.<p></p>
                    The latest version of C# includes an interactive window and team “YorkDevOffice” (Chris and Anton) used this to show that C# can now compete at Code Golf. Unfortunately they missed off the final verse of the rhythm and their quickly fixed version lost them a position.<p></p>
                    Team “Rusty Skills” (James and Roy) improved their Rust coding abilities and were closely chased by team “Vesacorp” (Liam and Luke) with their various javascript approaches.<p></p>
                    And finally, team “Blunt at C#” (Daniel and Simon) managed a solution which was larger than if they had just printed out the entire rhyme…<p></p>
